<p align="center" style="font-size:30px;"><b>Libon East Central School, 2004-2010</b></p>

<p>Nothing special. Just an average kid that goes to school at 7 AM and goes home 4 PM. Sometimes, arriving home late 'cause i love playing with my friends.
I love hanging out with them. I'm not that kind of kid that has 'many' friends tho. Just a few of them, and as a kid, I was happy about that.</p>

<p>Fast forward to Grade 4, where I joined a drawing contest held by Intervida Foundation, which by the way was a wonderful charity that gives school supplies to
the students in our school. Fortunately, I won 2nd place on that contest, and they gave me art materials and a coloring book, which gave me a lot of happiness back then.</p>

<p>Jumping to Grade 6, where I was about to graduate elementary school. I had an award which was Special Mention. It's not really a big of a deal but yeah, at least my parents were happy. And that makes me happy.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:30px;"><b>Libon Private High School, 2010-2014</b></p>

<p>I passed the entrance exam and was one of the lucky ones to avail of the scholarship. That means I wouldn't have to pay for the tuition fee, which was a great thing for my parents.
I started being serious, especially with the fact that I have to maintain my grades for the scholarship. I was always passing my exams, sometimes even being the highest score. Not bragging about it, just proud of it. 
I also received awards on subjects, like Best in Computer, Best in English, Best in Science, and Best in Araling Panlipunan. Sadly, I lost my certificates and medals because we didn't have our own house. 
Regardless, it is on school records.</p>

<p>I was also active on school extra-curricular activities, like Essay Writing, both Filipino and English, Singing Contests, and Extemporaneous Speaking. I was also a member of the Drum and Lyre Corpse. I was a drummer.</p>

<p>Finally, I graduated March 23, 2014. I left high school with no problem and ready to take on college.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size:30px;"><b>Bicol University Polangui Campus, 2014-2018</b></p>

<p>I took the entrance exam on BUPC, and luckily I passed it. My first choice was Information Technology, and my second choice was Computer Engineering. Unfortunately all the slots 
to both courses were already full. The only course available was Computer Science. Without hesitations, I took the course.</p>

<p>The first 3 years of college was fine. Projects and requirements here and there. Midterms and finals. It was bittersweet. After all, I had my friends and classmates' support, especially my mother.</p>

<p>Fast forward 'again' to 4th year college (I'm doing a lot of fast forwards. That's how boring my life is). This was the time where I realized graduating from college really is a challenge. You have your thesis 
to worry about, the midterm and final exams which anyway was not just hard, but will eat up a lot of your time.</p>

<p>We were given at least 2 weeks to come up with a study. We were a total of four struggling computer science graduating students teaming up for an undergraduate thesis. 
One night, I came up with an idea of helping the people from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barangay" target="_blank">Barangay</a> near my place that experiences 
a lot of flooding. So as a study, we proposed an Android application that will help the residents of those barangay forecast a flood before a certain rain drops.</p>

<p>So after a lot of revisions, and after the Title and Final Defense, we actually made it for hardbound and it was one of the greatest feeling in the world. We even had 
the chance to compete on the Research and Development Forum on our campus. We also competed in the 14th Bicol University Best Undergraduate Thesis, where we competed with similar undergraduate 
theses from different BU campuses. Although we didn't win, it was a great honor being in that competition, and I was also very proud with the fact that my idea made it so far.</p>

<p>After the Research and Development Forum and 14th Bicol University Best Undergraduate Thesis, we were surprised that our study, Brgy. Bulusan Flood Forecasting Application, won as the 
Best Undergraduate Thesis for Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. All the hard work, time and effort were never wasted.</p>

<p>Here are some of the pictures taken when we received the certificates for the award <i>Best Undergraduate Thesis for Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</i>: (will be uploaded soon)</p>
